# Data Cruncher Stack

This is a recipe for a Dockerized environment I'm using for machine/deep learning & sound processing experiments.

Features:
- GPU/CUDA 8.0 support
- Python 3.5/Jupyter Notebook/datascience stack
- Keras/TensorFlow/Theano/pylearn2
- some other goodies for sound processing & debugging

Hopefully, with the use of tags and automated builds, it should facilitate experiment replication efforts in the future.
